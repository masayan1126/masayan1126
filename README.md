## About masayan1126
I have 7 years of engineering experience across 3 companies. I have leadership experience in all domains including frontend, backend, and infrastructure. Most recently, as a senior engineer, I have excelled in a full-stack capacity across nearly all development processes and positions.

Technically, I specialize in highly maintainable code design and implementation utilizing clean architecture and automated testing. Another strength is my diverse experience beyond technical skills, including client negotiations, management, training, and speaking at seminars.
